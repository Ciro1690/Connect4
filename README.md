Connect 4 is built with:

Vanilla Javascript, HTML & CSS.

Functionality:
Upon entering the page, a user can hover the mouse over the top row that darkens to show possible moves. Once clicked, an animated piece drops and it is the next player's turn. Play continues until a tie or one player wins. At this point, the winner is declared and a button can be clicked to start a new game.
